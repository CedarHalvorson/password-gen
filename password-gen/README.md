# password-gen
For this project I started out by creating multiple arrays containing all characters needed for my password. 

I then created a function containing an if statement  that prompted the user to select a character amount between 8 and 128.

After that I created the rest of my prompts asking what specific characters they wanted from the array resulting in what I understand are bullions telling the program whether or not to use certain arrays. This is made possible by my if statements on lines 60-92

I then created a function that randomises the selected characters. 

I also created an empty array that holds the password.
